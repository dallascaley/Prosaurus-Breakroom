Here are my thoughts

1) any message that goes from front end to backend needs to be encrypted, especially authentication related messages

2) In order to do this. first figure out how to get HTTPS working.

Paraphrased from Chat GPT

A) Generate a self-signed SSL certificat

openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out key.pem

openssl req -new -key key.pem -out csr.pem

You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:CA
Locality Name (eg, city) []:Long Beach
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Cherry Blossom Development
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:Dallas Caley
Email Address []:dallascaley@gmail.com

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:W--c---1
An optional company name []:Prosaurus

openssl x509 -req -in csr.pem -signkey key.pem -out cert.pem

B) Configure Vue CLI to use HTTPS

In vue.config.js make it look like this:

module.exports = {
  devServer: {
    https: {
      key: fs.readFileSync('./path/to/key.pem'),
      cert: fs.readFileSync('./path/to/cert.pem'),
    },
    port: 8080, // You can change this port if needed
  },
};
