my docker-compose currently has this: command: sh -c "npm install && npm run dev"

While i suspect this works, it seems to be configured for dev not production.  how do i make this work for both?

You're exactly right to question this — the command:

  command: sh -c "npm install && npm run dev"
  is absolutely suitable for development, but not appropriate for production.

Let’s break it down and show you how to configure your docker-compose.yml for both dev and prod environments properly.

🧪 What That Command Does

  command: sh -c "npm install && npm run dev"
  
npm install installs all dependencies, including dev dependencies.

npm run dev typically runs a dev server like nodemon, Vite dev server, etc.

This keeps the process running in watch mode, with hot reload — good for local dev.

🚀 In Production
In production, you typically want:

To install only production dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm ci --omit=dev
or

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install --omit=dev
To run the compiled or production-ready build, e.g.:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run start
🛠 Recommended Setup Using Compose Override
Use a base docker-compose.yml for shared config and an override file (docker-compose.override.yml for dev, or docker-compose.prod.yml for production).

🔧 docker-compose.yml (Base)
yaml
Copy
Edit
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "${PORT}:${PORT}"
    environment:
      NODE_ENV: ${NODE_ENV}
    networks:
      - app-network
🧪 docker-compose.override.yml (for Dev)
Compose uses this automatically when you run docker-compose up.

yaml
Copy
Edit
services:
  app:
    command: sh -c "npm install && npm run dev"
    volumes:
      - ./src:/app/src
🚀 docker-compose.prod.yml
yaml
Copy
Edit
services:
  app:
    command: sh -c "npm install --omit=dev && npm run start"
Or better (if you can bake it into your Dockerfile):

yaml
Copy
Edit
services:
  app:
    command: npm run start
✅ Your Dockerfile Should Reflect This Too
For production builds, bake dependencies into the image:

Dockerfile
Copy
Edit
# Dockerfile

FROM node:18

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./

# Install only production deps
RUN npm install --omit=dev

COPY . .

# Build step (if needed, e.g., React/Vite frontend)
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
🔁 Switching Between Environments
🔧 Development (default):
bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose up
🚀 Production:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.production up -d --build
🧠 Summary
Environment	Command	Runs
Dev	npm install && npm run dev	Watches, reloads
Prod	npm install --omit=dev && npm run start	Runs optimized, no dev tools

Would you like me to help update your actual Dockerfile or docker-compose.yml based on this pattern?
