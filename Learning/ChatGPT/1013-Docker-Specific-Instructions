Let's start with the docker step.  My system is running in a Virtualbox Ubuntu instance (The VM), the host machine is Windows 11.  What should I install where?  What i mean by that is, should i start by installing docker on the VM, or should it be installed on the host computer?  and what exactly should i be installing?

Great! Let's start with the Docker setup, and I'll walk you through the process of installing it and running your applications in Docker containers. You’ll be dealing with a virtualized environment (VirtualBox VM running Ubuntu) and a host machine (Windows 11), so there are a few things to consider about where Docker should be installed.

Key Considerations:

Where should Docker be installed?

  You should install Docker on the VM running Ubuntu. This is because the VM is acting as your server (where you will eventually deploy your application in production), and you'll want Docker running there for consistency with your production environment.

  Docker on Windows would require running it within a Virtual Machine using something like WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2). It’s more straightforward to install Docker directly on the VM (Ubuntu), where you’ll do the actual development and eventually deploy.

Here's how you should go about it:

Step 1: Install Docker on the VM (Ubuntu)

  Update the package index: Open a terminal in your Ubuntu VM and run:

    sudo apt update

  Install required dependencies: You’ll need a few dependencies to install Docker, so run:

    sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

  Add Docker's official GPG key: To ensure the authenticity of the Docker packages, you need to add Docker's official GPG key:

    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

  Set up the Docker stable repository: You’ll need to add Docker’s repository to your APT sources list:

    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

  Update the package index again:

    sudo apt update

  Install Docker: Now, install Docker on your Ubuntu VM with:

    sudo apt install docker-ce

  Check if Docker is installed: Verify the Docker installation by checking the Docker version:

    docker --version

  Start and enable Docker service: Make sure Docker starts on boot:

    sudo systemctl enable docker
    sudo systemctl start docker

  (Optional) Add your user to the Docker group: By default, only root can run Docker commands. If you want to run Docker as a non-root user, you can add your user to the Docker group:

    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER

    After running this, log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

  Verify Docker installation: You can test if Docker is running properly by running:

    docker run hello-world

  This will pull a test image from Docker Hub and run it.

Step 2: Install Docker Compose (for multi-container setups)

Docker Compose is helpful for managing multi-container applications (e.g., your Vue.js frontend and Express.js backend). Here’s how to install it:

  Download the latest version of Docker Compose:

    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest | jq -r .tag_name)/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

  Set the correct permissions:

    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

  Verify the installation: Check that Docker Compose is installed correctly:

    docker-compose --version

Step 3: Install Docker on Windows (Optional for Development)

While Docker should primarily be installed on the VM (Ubuntu), you might want to install Docker on Windows too if you plan to develop or test on the host machine occasionally. This is optional and can be useful for rapid development.

  Download Docker Desktop for Windows:
  Download Docker Desktop from here.

Install Docker Desktop:

  Run the installer and follow the installation steps. Once installed, Docker Desktop should automatically start, and you can interact with Docker through the GUI or command line.

Enable WSL 2:

  Docker Desktop for Windows uses WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2) to run Linux containers. Make sure that WSL 2 is enabled on your Windows system. If it’s not enabled yet, you can follow the steps in Docker’s documentation:
  
  Install Docker Desktop on Windows.

Step 4: Setting Up Your Dockerized Application

Now that Docker is installed on the VM, you can proceed to set up your application. Here’s what you should do:

Create Dockerfiles for the frontend and backend:

  Frontend (Vue.js):

  Your Vue.js app will likely be built and served using something like Nginx in production. The Dockerfile for the frontend might look like this:

    dockerfile
  
    # Step 1: Build the Vue.js application
    FROM node:16 as build-stage
    WORKDIR /app
    COPY . .
    RUN npm install
    RUN npm run build

    # Step 2: Serve the Vue.js app with Nginx
    FROM nginx:alpine as production-stage
    COPY --from=build-stage /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
    EXPOSE 80
    CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

  Backend (Express.js):

  The Dockerfile for your Express.js application might look like this:

    dockerfile

    # Use the official Node.js image
    FROM node:16

    # Set the working directory
    WORKDIR /app

    # Copy the application files
    COPY . .

    # Install dependencies
    RUN npm install

    # Expose the port the app runs on
    EXPOSE 3000

    # Start the application
    CMD ["npm", "run", "devStart"]

Create a docker-compose.yml file to manage both containers:

  yaml

  version: "3"
  services:
    frontend:
      build:
        context: ./frontend
      ports:
        - "8080:80"
      networks:
        - app-network

    backend:
      build:
        context: ./backend
      ports:
        - "3000:3000"
      networks:
        - app-network

  networks:
    app-network:
      driver: bridge

Build and run the containers: In your project directory, run:

  docker-compose up --build

This will build both the frontend and backend containers and start them.

Step 5: Test the Docker Setup

Once everything is set up:

Frontend: Visit http://<VM_IP>:8080 to check your Vue.js app.
Backend: Visit http://<VM_IP>:3000 to check your Express.js backend.

Conclusion

Docker should be installed on the Ubuntu VM, where your production setup will eventually run.

You can optionally install Docker Desktop on Windows for testing/developing locally if needed.

Follow the steps above to install Docker, Docker Compose, and begin setting up Dockerfiles for your Vue.js and Express.js apps.

Once you have everything Dockerized, we can move on to configuring the rest of your production pipeline (Terraform, Kubernetes, etc.). Let me know if you run into any issues along the way!
