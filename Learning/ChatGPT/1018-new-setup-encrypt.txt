in order to run Certbot in docker, I assume you need to get inside the docker container somehow, can you tell me explicitly how to do that.  Also I assume that after you do this you will have a new cert inside the docker container only, which would go away the moment i stopped the container so I would need to know how to get the cert out of the container and into my host machine

ChatGPT said:

You're absolutely right on both counts:

Yes, you can run Certbot in Docker without needing to "get inside" the container by just using volumes.

Yes, if you don‚Äôt persist the certs via volumes or bind mounts, they will disappear when the container is removed.

Let me walk you through exactly how to run Certbot in Docker, generate a cert, and get that cert onto your Windows host machine.

‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Run Certbot in Docker on Windows

This assumes you have Docker Desktop installed and your domain points to your Windows IP (via DNS or hosts file) so Let‚Äôs Encrypt can reach it.

üîπ 1. Create a folder on your host for the certs
Open a PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:

mkdir C:\certbot
üîπ 2. Run the Certbot Docker container
In the same terminal:

docker run -it --rm ^
  -v C:\certbot:/etc/letsencrypt ^
  -v C:\certbot:/var/lib/letsencrypt ^
  -p 80:80 ^
  certbot/certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com
Replace yourdomain.com with your actual domain name.

This command:

Uses Certbot's standalone mode (runs its own web server on port 80)

Mounts C:\certbot so that certs persist on your Windows machine

üîπ 3. Accept the Let's Encrypt prompts
Certbot will ask for email and terms of service.

It will attempt to validate the domain by serving a challenge on port 80.

If successful, the certs will be stored inside:

C:\certbot\live\yourdomain.com\
You‚Äôll have:

fullchain.pem (cert + intermediate)

privkey.pem (private key)

cert.pem, chain.pem, etc.

üîπ 4. Use the certs in NGINX or Docker
If you're using Docker Compose, mount the certs like:

volumes:
  - C:\certbot\live\yourdomain.com:/etc/ssl/certs
Or copy the files manually into your project's nginx/conf directory if you're not mounting them directly.

üîÅ Renewing the cert later
The same Docker command can be run again to renew ‚Äî just add --force-renewal if needed for testing:

docker run -it --rm ^
  -v C:\certbot:/etc/letsencrypt ^
  -v C:\certbot:/var/lib/letsencrypt ^
  -p 80:80 ^
  certbot/certbot renew --force-renewal

üß† Summary

Task	Tool	Result

Run Certbot in Docker	certbot/certbot image	Runs standalone server to request certs
Persist certs to host	-v C:\certbot:/etc/...	You get real files on your Windows filesystem
View certs on Windows	C:\certbot\live\...	Certs in PEM format ready for NGINX/etc
Use in reverse proxy	Mount or copy them in	Hook into NGINX, Caddy, Traefik, etc.

Let me know your reverse proxy setup (Docker Compose? NGINX directly?) and I can help wire the certs in directly.


Day 2, I tried the following:

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout local.key -out local.crt -subj "/CN=local.prosaurus.com"

docker run --rm -v %cd%:/out alpine/openssl  req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /out/local.key -out /out/local.crt -subj "/CN=local.prosaurus.com"

docker run --rm -v "$(Get-Location):/out" alpine/openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048  -keyout /out/local.key -out /out/local.crt -subj "/CN=local.prosaurus.com"

all based on suggestion from ChatGPT, not bueno.
