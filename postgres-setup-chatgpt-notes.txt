To install PostgreSQL on Ubuntu, follow these steps:

1. Update your package lists
Before installing any new software, it’s a good idea to make sure your package list is up to date.

Open a terminal and run:

	sudo apt update


2. Install PostgreSQL
Install PostgreSQL and its related packages:

	sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib

postgresql is the core PostgreSQL package.
postgresql-contrib contains additional utilities and extensions for PostgreSQL.


3. Check PostgreSQL service status
After installation, PostgreSQL should start automatically. You can check the status of the PostgreSQL service to make sure it’s running:

	sudo systemctl status postgresql

If it's not running, start it with:

	sudo systemctl start postgresql

To enable it to start automatically at boot:

	sudo systemctl enable postgresql


4. Switch to the PostgreSQL user
By default, PostgreSQL uses a special system user called postgres. To interact with the database, you can switch to this user:

	sudo -i -u postgres


5. Access the PostgreSQL prompt
Once you’re logged in as the postgres user, you can access the PostgreSQL command-line interface (CLI) by running:

	psql

This will open the PostgreSQL shell, where you can run SQL commands. You should see a prompt like this:

	postgres=#


6. Create a database and user
To create a new database and user, you can run these commands within the psql shell.

To create a new database:

	CREATE DATABASE mydatabase;

To create a new user with a password:

	CREATE USER myuser WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword';

	CREATE DATABASE breakroom;
	CREATE USER splort WITH PASSWORD 'glorp';


Grant the user privileges on the database:

	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE mydatabase TO myuser;

To exit the PostgreSQL prompt:

	\q

(this is where i stopped)

7. Configure PostgreSQL for remote connections (Optional)
If you want PostgreSQL to accept remote connections, you'll need to adjust some configuration files.

Edit the PostgreSQL configuration file postgresql.conf to listen on all IP addresses:

sudo nano /etc/postgresql/{version}/main/postgresql.conf
Replace {version} with your PostgreSQL version number (e.g., 12, 13, etc.). Look for the listen_addresses setting and change it to:

listen_addresses = '*'
Next, edit the pg_hba.conf file to allow remote connections:

sudo nano /etc/postgresql/{version}/main/pg_hba.conf
Add the following line at the end of the file:

host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0            md5
This allows any IP address to connect to PostgreSQL. Adjust the IP range if you need to restrict access.

Restart PostgreSQL to apply the changes:

sudo systemctl restart postgresql
8. Install PostgreSQL client (Optional)
If you want to connect to the PostgreSQL database from another machine, you’ll need to install the PostgreSQL client on that machine:

sudo apt install postgresql-client
You should now have PostgreSQL installed and running on your Ubuntu system! You can access it using the psql command, and you’re ready to start managing your databases.
